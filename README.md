# Overview

This website is a test mock up of a fake website to help me get comfortable with using design tools in Figma.

The purpose of this project was to introduce myself to the Figma software and get comfortable with its ability to create code.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
